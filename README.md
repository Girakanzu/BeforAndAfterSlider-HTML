# BeforAndAfterSlider-HTML
Hello,

Just a quick and dirty test on how to create a Befor & After Slider image for websites.
The goal is to make a slider that does 2 superimposed images appear side to side to get a Befor1After effect.

I'm posting here to get some feedbacks and way to understand and improve it.
  - Make the container resize based on image's size and not hardcoded dimensions
  - Slider and border between pictures shouldn't have that "lag" when slider is moved and border takes time to change
  
I really appreciate your feedback since i'm a BIG NOOB at coding.
